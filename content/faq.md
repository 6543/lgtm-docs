# Why don't I see my repository?

Here are some tips for troubleshooting:

* Is your GitHub repository public?
* Do you have Admin access to the repository?
* Did you recently create the repository? There may be up to a 15 minute delay due to internal caching.

# Can I use with private repositories?

Not with the free hosted service at this time.

In order to use with private repositories you will need to install and run your
own instance, which is really really simple, we promise. See the [the documentation](../install).

# Can I use with GitHub Enterprise?

In order to use with GitHub Enterprise you will need to install and run your
own instance. See the [the documentation](../install).

# Can I install on my own server?

Yes, we have a Docker image available. See the [the documentation](../install).
